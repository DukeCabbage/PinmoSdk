    <!--All resources in a library default to public. To make all resources implicitly private,
    you must define at least one specific attribute as public. Resources include all files in your
     projectâ€™s res/ directory, such as images. To prevent users of your library from accessing
     resources intended only for internal use, you should use this automatic private designation
     mechanism by declaring one or more public resources. Alternately, you can make all resources
     private by adding an empty <public /> tag , which marks nothing as public, which makes
      everything else (all resources) private.-->
